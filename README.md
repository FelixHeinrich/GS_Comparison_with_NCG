# GS_Comparison_with_NCG
Comparing methods for genomic prediction using normalized cumulative gain

The R script contains functions to run multiple different genomic prediction algorithms on a dataset with a repeated cross-validation.
For comparing the methods the results can then be visualized using Pearson's correlation coefficient but also the normalized cumulative gain.

Genotype and phenotype data needs to be in the .raw format used by [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats).

The datasets that we analyzed in our study can be found as compressed files under [Datasets](https://github.com/FelixHeinrich/GS_Comparison_with_NCG/tree/main/Datasets).
